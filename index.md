# The Society of Young Network Scientists

The Society of Young Network Scientists (SYNS) and NetPlace have joined forces to serve young scholars and early carreer researchers in network science and complex systems even better. The two organizations have merged and are now operating under the name **NetPlace**. You can find out who we are, what we do, and how you can get involved on our [new website](https://netplace.site/), or follow us on [Twitter/X](https://x.com/netplace_semi) or [bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/netplace.bsky.social).
